# instafeed-photoslicer
This application takes any given photo and allows the user to crop it into a square
following this it slices the picture into 9 squares, so that they can be posted individually on instagram, reulting in a large image while viewing the instagram feed.
This eliminates the need to tediously attempt to crop it with precision.

We can split it into sub goals with milestones

MILESTONE 1
Crop any given image into a square

MILESTONE 2
Take an image from the user through file manager
Then try to get it through gallery

MILESTONE 3

make both the subimages available to downlead

MILESTONE 4

Make each image downloadable
